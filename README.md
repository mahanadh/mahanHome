The start page is startpage.php and then other pages will follow. I have used OOP in the Login/Registeration. 
The user will be able to upload a full time till 2048kn(longblob is used in MySQL). 
The selected image is stored in database and read from it and displayed in the same page.
Hope you like it :)
