The start page is startpage.php and then other pages will follow. I have used OOP in the Login/Registeration. 
The user will be able to upload a full time size image till 2048kb(longblob is used in MySQL). 
The selected image is stored in database and read from it and displayed in the same page.
Hope you like it :)
